# Is College Worth the Debt?
# Exploring the Value of Higher Education



You’ll provide advice and recommendations to a hypothetical high-schooler with limited savings for
college. She hasn’t committed to a major or type of school, but wants to keep debt to a minimum and pay
off student loans within 10 years of graduating. Her questions include:
1. What should I major in to make the most money after graduation?
2. Will a high SAT score improve my employment outcomes?
3. Are there more affordable alternatives to the US News top 50 that would get me comparable outcomes?
Note: You’ll need to use the top_50 variable and make some assumptions and judgment calls to come to
a recommendation, there's no "right answer."
